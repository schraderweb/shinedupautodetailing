                  We have purchased two hoists through Perfect Shores. Matt was
                  great to work with and guided us in selecting the right
                  products for our needs. His knowledge was invaluable in making
                  the decision on which hoist to purchase. Even after the hoists
                  were delivered, he assisted us with setting them up. His
                  service did not end with there. Every time we have had a

                  worked with us and his supplier to solve them. Matt is
                  pleasant, punctual and efficient. We would highly recommend
                  him.
