                  Matt and his company were phenomenal in helping me with a new
                  cover for my pontoon hoist. He was very detailed, and followed
                  up with me constantly until the new cover arrived. The quality
                  of the cover was excellent and I would recommend him to
                  anyone.

                  We have purchased two hoists through Perfect Shores. Matt was
                  great to work with and guided us in selecting the right
                  products for our needs. His knowledge was invaluable in making
                  the decision on which hoist to purchase. Even after the hoists
                  were delivered, he assisted us with setting them up. His
                  service did not end with there. Every time we have had a
                  question, Matt has promptly responded. We highly recommend
                  Perfect Shores and Matt Glenn.

                  It has been our pleasure to work with Matt Glenn. He has an
                  “old-fashioned“ commitment to his customers. After our
                  purchase, Matt has continued to install our fan in the spring
                  and remove the fan in the fall. This service has been so
                  valued by us. Any problems we have encountered, Matt has
                  worked with us and his supplier to solve them. Matt is
                  pleasant, punctual and efficient. We would highly recommend
                  him.
